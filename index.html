            <h1>$AMC</h1>
            <p>GameStop (GMS) and AMC Theaters (AMC) are two companies that had something in common during the early months of 2020. They were both considered outdated, operating with a tired business model that relied on in-person customers in an increasingly cyber, e-commerce era. Investors weren't excited about the future of either stock's price, and there was a lot of talk in the media about how they were dinosaurs of the entertainment industry.</p>
